                        I may employ third-party companies and

                        them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
                        disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

                        I value your trust in providing us your

                        acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
                        of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
                        storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                        guarantee its absolute security.

                        I discover that a child under 13 has provided
